Welcome to my snake game that I have built with the use of Kaboom and Javascript in replit. 

The tutorial for this application was found in replit documentation which can be found in the following link:
https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/21-build-snake-with-kaboom 

The main aim of using this tutorial to build this game was to get a better understanding of kaboom, practice using Javascript, and to try building a fun application.
